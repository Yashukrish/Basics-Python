        "\n",
        "  -> Keywords are reserved words in Python that have special meanings and cannot be used as identifiers.They are case sensitive and cannot be redefined within python program. Key words like if, else, while, for, def, class, import, try, except, return, True, False, None, etc.\n",

It is used when you want to perform operations that require specific types or to ensure compatibility between different data types they are two types 1) Implicit Type casting - this can happen automatically during the runtime. 2) Explicit Type casting  - this involves manually converting a variable's data type using specific functions"
